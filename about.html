		<p>Originally from Bordeaux, a wine-making region in the South West of France, I moved to Paris to study linguistics, languages and Teaching F.L.E (French as a Foreign Language.) </p>
		<p>Although I was in love with vibrant Paris, the capital of arts and romance, I left to sail half of the globe. My travels offered me a chance to work in many cultural settings and share my passion for the French language and culture with the world. Many years of teaching, combined with my own study of foreign languages have made me aware of the needs, and sometimes frustrations, encountered by those wanting to achieve a convincing accent.  </p>
		<p>I am now based in Auckland, New Zealand with my two teenage children. I love the blend of fast-paced city life and the peace of the rural suburb where I live.</p>
		<p>You’ll often find me walking in the hills of the Waitakere Ranges or enjoying the wild West Coast beaches. I like to watch French movies, cook delicious vegetarian food and write poetry.</p>
		<p>I am hard-working and always ensure my students receive the very best pedagogy. I’m patient and dedicated. I’ll teach you the skills needed to acquire an authentic and convincing French accent. We’ll work together at getting your pronunciation and mannerism right, so you can act out French with complete panache.</p>
